$DisplayMsg1 = "<p>My husband and I moved to the North Country 2 years ago from the Newburyport, MA area where I worked for Hood Canvas sewing boat tops and cushions.
</p>

    <p>I have always enjoyed working with various forms of fabric. From knitting and crocheting, to designing and constructing king size custom quilts for family and friends.
</p>
    <p>Somewhere between my copious amounts of left over quilting fabric and my desire
to downsize my purse (for those times I didn't need to carry all that stuff); necessity met creativity 
</p>
";

$DisplayMsg2 =  "<p>and the result was a hand quilted wallet a little larger than a dollar bill. The size made it easy to slip into a coat or pants pocket.  It contained 8 slots for credit cards, licenses or other card shaped items; a zipper compartment for keys, change and any other small items that might need corralling and a pocket for money, receipts, or checks. 
</p>

<p>Since then I became overwhelmed with requests form friends and family who had seen the quilted wallet to make one for them. I was turning them out like hotcakes. As easy as one foot follows the other, I decided to take my show on the road.  Thus we developed Mad Moose Creations Since then I have expanded with new sizes and fabric colors.
</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoy these quilted wallets as much as I enjoy making them.
</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Lisa</p>
